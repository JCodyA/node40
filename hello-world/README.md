# hello-world

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!  This project was created using the getting started guide for dropwizard, and follows given guidance.  The code will start as specified with: `java -jar example/hello-world-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar server hello-world.yml` and will produce the specified output with `curl http://localhost:8080/hello-world` 

I also included the optional task of including the Dockerfile.  While testing the docker container I ran into non-related issues with my workspace and couldn't successfully test it.

I followed the initial gradle introduction with no problem, and with some guidance I'm sure I would be able to use it instead of Maven. Also with a bit more time and guidance I'm sure adding a second recource method and unit testing would not be too difficult.
